# The Setting model will be autoloaded by Rails when needed
# Default values are defined in the model using environment variables
# Database overrides are handled automatically by the gem

# The Settings compatibility layer (config/settings.rb) will be autoloaded
# when first accessed. This avoids the autoloading deprecation warning
# during Rails initialization.
