# Vulcan Application Modernization Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the complete modernization strategy for the Vulcan application, covering backend, middleware, and frontend components. It establishes a phased approach with clear milestones, decision points, and success criteria to keep the migration focused and manageable.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Incremental Progress**: Prefer smaller, focused changes over sweeping rewrites
2. **Measured Outcomes**: Define clear success criteria for each phase
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain functionality throughout the migration
4. **Testing First**: Establish comprehensive tests before making significant changes
5. **Ruthless Prioritization**: Defer non-essential improvements to future phases
6. **Continuous Integration**: Keep the application deployable at all times
7. **Technical Debt Reduction**: Address existing issues before adding new complexity
8. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Use metrics and benchmarks to guide architectural choices

## Phase 0: Webpacker Migration Completion and Documentation (Current)

### Objectives
- Complete the migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails
- Document all temporary simplifications made during migration
- Establish security baseline and identify vulnerabilities
- Review existing GitHub issues for relevance to modernization

### Tasks
- [x] Audit all JavaScript dependencies
- [x] Create migration inventory of all Webpacker views/components
- [x] Migrate core entry points (application, navbar, toaster, login)
- [ ] Migrate remaining entry points (projects, rules, users, etc.)
- [ ] Update all view templates to use new asset helpers
- [ ] Document all temporary simplifications made (components, database.yml, etc.)
- [ ] Create inventory of changes that need to be restored before production
- [ ] Review and triage 76 open GitHub issues
- [ ] Conduct security scan to identify CVEs and vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document current component architecture and dependencies

### Success Criteria
- All assets successfully build with jsbundling-rails (no Webpacker)
- All features function identically to pre-migration
- Complete inventory of simplified components and configurations
- Prioritized list of GitHub issues to address
- Security vulnerabilities identified and prioritized
- Clear documentation of current architecture exists

### Decision Points
- **GO/NO-GO**: Proceed to next phase only when all entry points are successfully migrated

- [ ] Install and configure rails-settings-cached for database-backed configuration
- [ ] Install and configure ActiveAdmin for web-based administration interface
- [ ] Create admin authentication and authorization system
- [ ] Migrate safe settings from environment variables to database-backed configuration:
  - Welcome text and contact information
  - Session timeout settings (with validation)
  - User registration and project creation permissions
  - Email template customizations
- [ ] Create basic admin interface for settings management

**Phase 3.5.2: User Management (2-3 hours)**
- [ ] Build comprehensive admin interface for user management
- [ ] Implement batch operations (bulk admin assignment, account confirmation)
- [ ] Add user search, filtering, and management capabilities
- [ ] Create audit logging for all administrative actions

**Phase 3.5.3: Feature Flags (1-2 hours)**
- [ ] Install and configure Flipper with web UI for feature management
- [ ] Implement feature flags for experimental features
- [ ] Enable A/B testing capabilities for UI improvements
- [ ] Create gradual feature rollout mechanisms

**Phase 3.5.4: Bulk Operations (2-4 hours)**
- [ ] Implement STIG/SRG bulk import and update operations
- [ ] Create component batch management capabilities
- [ ] Add automated maintenance task scheduling
- [ ] Build background job monitoring interface

### Technology Stack
- **rails-settings-cached**: Database-backed configuration with automatic caching
- **ActiveAdmin**: Complete admin interface framework (battle-tested)
- **Flipper + Flipper-UI**: Feature flags and runtime feature management
- **Background jobs**: For bulk operations and maintenance tasks

### Security Architecture
```ruby
# Security-critical settings (remain environment variables):
- Database connections (DATABASE_URL)
- OIDC client secrets (VULCAN_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET)
- Encryption keys and LDAP credentials

# Administrative settings (move to database-backed):
- UI customizations and welcome text
- Session timeout and user permissions
- Email templates and notification settings
- Feature flags for experimental features
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero-restart configuration changes for administrative settings
- [ ] Web-based admin interface accessible to authorized users
- [ ] Bulk user operations (admin assignment, confirmation, etc.) functional
- [ ] Feature flags enable safe experimental feature deployment
- [ ] STIG/SRG bulk import and management capabilities operational
- [ ] All administrative changes include comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Settings cached automatically (< 10ms retrieval time)
- [ ] Admin interface responsive (< 2s page loads)
- [ ] Security boundaries maintained between critical and administrative settings

### Decision Points
- **SECURITY**: Validate separation between security-critical and administrative settings
- **PERFORMANCE**: Ensure caching strategy meets enterprise scale requirements
- **AUTHORIZATION**: Determine granular permission levels for admin interface
- **INTEGRATION**: Assess integration with existing authentication systems

### Dependencies
- **BLOCKING**: Phase 0 completion (Webpacker migration, Ruby 3.2+ upgrade)
- **REQUIRED**: Rails 7+ and modern asset pipeline
- **OPTIONAL**: Redis/Memcached for enhanced settings caching

### Estimated Effort
**Total**: 8-12 hours across 2-3 sprints
**Priority**: Medium (after infrastructure modernization)
**References**: Issue #673 - Comprehensive implementation plan

## Phase 4: Advanced Features and Optimizations

- [ ] Conduct accessibility audit and address issues
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations for data-heavy screens
- [ ] Enhance caching strategies for API responses
- [ ] Implement offline-first capabilities where appropriate

## Prioritization Framework

When making decisions about feature implementation or technical approaches, use the following framework:

### Must-Have (Required for this phase)
- Features critical to core application functionality
- Security-related improvements
- Performance issues affecting usability
- Blocking dependencies for future phases

### Should-Have (Important but not blocking)
- Significant developer experience improvements
- Performance optimizations with measurable impact
- Features with high user value and moderate implementation cost

### Could-Have (Desirable but deferrable)
- Nice-to-have features with limited user impact
- Refactoring that improves code quality but doesn't affect functionality
- Performance optimizations for edge cases

### Won't-Have (Explicitly deprioritized)
- Features requiring significant new technology adoption
- Changes requiring major architectural shifts
- Optimizations with minimal measurable impact
- Features not aligned with application core purpose

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Evaluate all dependencies for Vue 3 compatibility
- **Performance Degradation**: Benchmark before and after major changes
- **API Breaking Changes**: Version APIs and maintain backward compatibility
- **Data Migration**: Plan for seamless data model transitions

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Use this document to focus efforts on planned work
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Provide training for new technologies
- **Testing Gaps**: Prioritize test coverage before major changes
- **Timeline Pressure**: Explicitly defer non-essential features

## Maintenance and Updates

This roadmap is a living document and should be revisited at the completion of each phase. Updates should include:

- Lessons learned from completed phases
- Refinements to upcoming phase plans
- Adjustments to priorities based on user feedback
- Updates to technical approach based on evolving best practices

## Conclusion

By following this roadmap, we will modernize the Vulcan application in a controlled, incremental manner that minimizes risk while maximizing value. Regular evaluation of progress against this plan will help keep the team focused on the most important improvements.

Remember: The most important outcome is a stable, maintainable application that meets user needs, not perfect adherence to any specific technology or architecture.
