## Development Process

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/vulcan.git
   cd vulcan
   ```
3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:mitre/vulcan.git
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Setup database**:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   rails db:seed
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   foreman start -f Procfile.dev
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Follow the coding standards**:
   - Ruby: Follow RuboCop rules (run `bundle exec rubocop`)
   - JavaScript: Follow ESLint rules (run `yarn lint`)
   - Vue: Follow Vue style guide
   - Write clear, self-documenting code
   - Add comments for complex logic

2. **Write tests**:
   - Add RSpec tests for Ruby code
   - Ensure all tests pass: `bundle exec rspec`
   - Maintain or improve code coverage

3. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Update ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md for new config options
   - Add inline documentation for public methods
   - Update CHANGELOG.md

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature

   - Detailed description of what changed
   - Why this change was needed
   - Any breaking changes or migrations required"
   ```

   Follow conventional commits:
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `test:` Test additions or corrections
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Submitting Changes

1. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub
   - Click "New pull request"
   - Select your feature branch
   - Fill in the PR template with:
     - Description of changes
     - Related issue numbers
     - Testing performed
     - Screenshots (if UI changes)

3. **PR Review Process**:
   - A maintainer will review your PR
   - Address any requested changes
   - Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test file
bundle exec rspec spec/models/user_spec.rb

# Run tests with coverage
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests first (TDD) when possible
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use factories instead of fixtures
- Mock external services
- Ensure tests are deterministic

## Style Guidelines

### Ruby Style

We use RuboCop to enforce Ruby style:

```bash
# Check for violations
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-fix violations
bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect-all
```

Key conventions:
- 2 spaces for indentation
- No trailing whitespace
- Meaningful variable and method names
- Prefer single quotes for strings without interpolation

### JavaScript/Vue Style

We use ESLint and Prettier:

```bash
# Check and fix JavaScript
yarn lint

# Format code
yarn format
```

Key conventions:
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Follow Vue.js style guide
- Meaningful component and variable names

## Database Changes

When making database changes:

1. Create a migration:
   ```bash
   rails generate migration AddFieldToModel field:type
   ```

2. Write reversible migrations when possible

3. Test migrations:
   ```bash
   rails db:migrate
   rails db:rollback
   rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Update seeds if needed: `db/seeds.rb`

## Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Add comments for complex logic
- **Method Documentation**: Use YARD format for Ruby
- **API Documentation**: Update if endpoints change
- **User Documentation**: Update wiki for user-facing changes

## Release Process

Maintainers handle releases, but you can help by:

1. Keeping CHANGELOG.md updated
2. Following semantic versioning in PRs
3. Highlighting breaking changes
4. Testing release candidates
