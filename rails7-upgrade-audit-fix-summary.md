# Rails 7 Upgrade - Audited Gem Issue Summary

## The Problem
When upgrading from Rails 6.1 to Rails 7.0, we encountered the error:
```
ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Audits is invalid
```

This occurred when saving any model that uses the `audited` gem, particularly during tests.

## Root Cause
1. **Rails 5+ Default Behavior**: Since Rails 5.0, `belongs_to` associations are required by default (`belongs_to_required_by_default = true`)
2. **Audited Gem Design**: The audited gem's `Audited::Audit` class defines `belongs_to :user, polymorphic: true`
3. **The Conflict**: When audits are created without a logged-in user (e.g., in tests, background jobs, or system-generated changes), the `user` is `nil`, which fails Rails' required validation

## Investigation Journey
1. Initially tried to fix by inheriting from `Audited.audit_class` - caused circular dependency
2. Attempted to set `username: 'System'` - Rails treated it as a polymorphic association
3. Tried removing manual audit creation - didn't solve the validation issue
4. Updated audited gem from 5.3.3 to 5.8.0 - issue persisted
5. Attempted various approaches to make the user association optional

## The Solution
In `app/lib/vulcan_audit.rb`, we removed the user presence validation that Rails automatically adds:

```ruby
# Remove the user presence validation that Rails adds for belongs_to associations
_validators[:user].reject! { |v| v.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Validations::PresenceValidator) }
_validate_callbacks.each do |callback|
  if callback.filter.is_a?(ActiveRecord::Validations::PresenceValidator) && 
     callback.filter.attributes.include?(:user)
    _validate_callbacks.delete(callback)
  end
end
```

## Impact on Vulcan's Behavior

### What Changed:
1. **Audited gem version**: Updated from 5.3.3 to 5.8.0
2. **Validation removal**: Removed the requirement for audits to have a user

### What Didn't Change:
1. **Audit creation logic**: Audits are still created the same way
2. **User tracking**: When a user IS present, it's still tracked properly
3. **Audit functionality**: All audit features work as before
4. **Business logic**: No changes to Vulcan's actual functionality

### This is a Rails 7 Side Effect:
- The issue is purely due to Rails 7's stricter validation requirements
- The audited gem was designed before this Rails default existed
- Our fix simply restores the pre-Rails 5 behavior for audit records only
- This is a common issue when upgrading Rails with the audited gem

## Current Status (as of commit 10cc6ab)
- ✅ Fixed the "Audits is invalid" error
- ✅ Component tests that were failing due to audit validation now pass
- ❓ CI is running to check if all 62 test failures are resolved
- ⚠️ Found 2 unrelated test failures in component_spec.rb (release validation tests)

## Next Steps
1. Wait for CI results to see if the 62 failures are resolved
2. Investigate the 2 component release validation test failures
3. Consider if we need to update to audited 5.8.0 or if we can stay on 5.3.3 (since the version update didn't fix the issue, just the validation removal did)
