# About Vulcan

## What is Vulcan?

Vulcan is a comprehensive tool designed to streamline the creation of Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) ready security guidance documentation and InSpec automated validation profiles. It bridges the gap between security requirements and practical implementation, enabling organizations to develop both human-readable instructions and machine-readable validation code simultaneously.

## Purpose

Vulcan models the STIG creation process, facilitating the alignment of security controls from high-level DISA Security Requirements Guides (SRGs) into STIGs tailored to specific system components. Content developed with Vulcan can be submitted to DISA for peer review and formal publication as official STIGs.

## Key Capabilities

### üìã STIG Process Modeling
Manages the complete workflow between vendors and sponsors for STIG development.

### üîç InSpec Integration
Write and test validation code locally or across SSH, AWS, and Docker targets directly within the platform.

### üìä Control Management
Track control status, revision history, and relationships between requirements and implementations.

### üë• Collaborative Authoring
Multiple authors can work on control sets with built-in review workflows and approval processes.

### üîó Cross-Reference Capabilities
Look up related controls across published STIGs to ensure consistency and completeness.

### üìö STIG Library
View and reference DISA-published STIG content for guidance and examples.
