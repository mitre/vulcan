## Session Progress Today
### Successfully Completed:
1. ✅ Created clean branch `fix/okta-authentication-issues` from master
2. ✅ Applied all 5 Okta fixes to the clean branch
3. ✅ Committed changes with proper co-authorship (commit: e08dbb0)
4. ✅ Fixed RVM PATH issues by adding RVM configuration to end of ~/.zshrc
5. ✅ Created `.ruby-gemset` file with "vulcan"
6. ✅ Installed all Ruby gems in the vulcan gemset
7. ✅ Set up PostgreSQL in Docker (docker-compose.dev.yml)
8. ✅ Created and seeded database (vulcan_vue_development)
9. ✅ Created `.nvmrc` file specifying Node 16
10. ✅ Updated `bin/start-okta-dev` script to handle both Ruby and Node versions
11. ✅ Fixed `.env` file VULCAN_CONFIG pointing to non-existent file
12. ✅ Created `.rvmrc` to silence PATH warnings
13. ✅ Added version requirements to CLAUDE.md

### Environment Setup:
- Ruby: 2.7.5 with gemset "vulcan" ✅
- Node.js: 16.x (matches production) ✅
- PostgreSQL: 12 running in Docker ✅
- Database: vulcan_vue_development (created and seeded) ✅
- Okta credentials: Configured in .env.development.local ✅
  - Domain: trial-8371755.okta.com
  - Client ID: 0oas3uve5k2VeT8KV697

### Testing Completed Today:
1. ✅ Added dotenv-rails and foreman gems for better dev environment
2. ✅ Fixed environment variable configuration (boolean casting, vulcan.yml overrides)
3. ✅ Fixed OKTA logout functionality (correct /oauth2/v1/logout endpoint)
4. ✅ Verified all OKTA authentication flows work correctly:
   - First-time login creates user ✅
   - Subsequent logins work (existing user fix verified) ✅
   - Logout clears both local and OKTA sessions ✅
   - User is re-prompted after logout ✅

### Environment Variables Fixed:
- Added proper boolean casting with ActiveModel::Type::Boolean
- Updated vulcan.yml to use environment variables instead of hardcoded values
- Fixed SMTP configuration structure
- Created comprehensive ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md documentation
- Ensured consistency across code, config files, and documentation

## Session Progress (Evening - June 7, 2025):
1. ✅ Ran existing test suite - found 3 failures (unrelated to OKTA)
2. ✅ Created unit tests for OKTA authentication (spec/models/user_okta_spec.rb) - PASSING
3. ✅ Fixed test configuration (added slack config to test environment)
4. ✅ Suppressed Ruby 2.7 net-protocol warnings in tests
5. ✅ Researched OKTA testing best practices from other projects
6. ✅ Created OmniauthTestHelpers for better test support

## Latest Test Results:
- OKTA unit tests: 7 examples, 0 failures ✅ (including discovery fallback tests)
- Main test suite: 103 examples, 0 failures (excluding browser tests)
- OKTA authentication working end-to-end in development
- Feature tests marked as pending when chromedriver not available

## Key Files Created/Modified in Late Session:
- app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb - Added OIDC discovery for logout
- All authentication files - Added comprehensive Rails.logger calls
- spec/controllers/sessions_controller_spec.rb - Added discovery fallback test
- README.md - Added OKTA setup instructions
- PR_MESSAGE.md - Comprehensive PR documentation
- spec/features/local_login_spec.rb - Fixed to skip when chromedriver missing

## Key Files from Earlier Sessions:
- spec/models/user_okta_spec.rb - Unit tests for OKTA fixes
- spec/support/omniauth_test_helpers.rb - Test helper module
- config/vulcan.yml - Fixed test environment configuration
- spec/rails_helper.rb - Suppressed Ruby warnings
- ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md - Comprehensive env var documentation

## Discovery Experiment Status:
We experimented with enabling OIDC auto-discovery but found:
- The omniauth_openid_connect gem supports discovery via `discovery: true`
- Multiple .env files were loading (`.env.development` overrides `.env`)
- We reverted to the working configuration before committing
- Discovery would reduce required env vars from 8+ to just 4

## Ready for PR:
1. All OKTA fixes implemented and tested
2. OIDC discovery for logout endpoint working
3. Comprehensive logging throughout auth flow
4. 7 passing tests with good coverage
5. Documentation updated (README, ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)
6. PR message ready in PR_MESSAGE.md
7. Future improvements tracked as GitHub issues

## Environment Variable Notes:
Currently using manual endpoint configuration. With discovery enabled, would only need:
- VULCAN_OIDC_ISSUER_URL
- VULCAN_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
- VULCAN_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
- VULCAN_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI

## Key Files Modified:
- app/models/user.rb (lines 37-38: provider/uid update)
- app/controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb (lines 14-16: ID token storage)
- app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb (NEW: OIDC logout)
- config/routes.rb (line 7: sessions controller)
- config/vulcan.default.yml (line 62: prompt parameter)

## Test Credentials:

## OKTA Testing Research Findings:

### Best Practices from Other Projects:

#### 1. **Discourse** (discourse/discourse):
**Repository**: https://github.com/discourse/discourse
- Major Rails forum software with comprehensive OAuth testing
- **Key Files**:
  - `spec/system/social_authentication_spec.rb` - Full integration tests
  - `spec/support/omniauth_helpers.rb` - Test helper utilities
- **Testing Approach**:
  - Uses `OmniAuth.config.test_mode = true`
  - Creates detailed mock auth hashes with all required fields
  - Tests both new user creation and existing user login flows
  - Includes system/integration tests with Capybara
- **Example from their helper**:
  ```ruby
  def mock_auth(provider, uid: "12345", email: "user@example.com", name: "John Doe")
    OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[provider] = OmniAuth::AuthHash.new(
      provider: provider.to_s,
      uid: uid,
      info: { email: email, name: name },
      credentials: { token: "mock_token" }
    )
  end
  ```

#### 2. **OpenFoodNetwork** (openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork):
**Repository**: https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork
- E-commerce platform with OIDC authentication
- **Key Files**:
  - `spec/requests/omniauth_callbacks_controller_spec.rb` - Request specs for OAuth callbacks
- **Testing Approach**:
  - Tests OIDC specifically with request specs
  - Mocks the entire OAuth flow at the controller level
  - Tests error conditions and edge cases
  - Uses factory patterns for creating test users
- **Example test pattern**:
  ```ruby
  context "when user exists with matching email" do
    let!(:user) { create(:user, email: auth_email) }
    
    it "updates provider and uid" do
      expect { post_callback }
        .to change { user.reload.provider }.from(nil).to('oidc')
        .and change { user.reload.uid }.from(nil).to('12345')
    end
  end
  ```

#### 3. **CitizenLab** (CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab):
**Repository**: https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab
- Civic engagement platform with multiple OAuth providers
- **Key Files**:
  - `back/engines/commercial/id_id_austria/spec/requests/id_austria_verification_spec.rb`
  - Multiple OAuth provider test examples
- **Testing Approach**:
  - Separate test files for each OAuth provider
  - Comprehensive error handling tests
  - Tests for token expiration and refresh
  - Integration with their user verification system
- **Example pattern**:
  ```ruby
  before do
    OmniAuth.config.test_mode = true
    OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[:id_austria] = auth_hash
  end
  
  after do
    OmniAuth.config.test_mode = false
    OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[:id_austria] = nil
  end
  ```

### Common Testing Patterns:
- Mock auth at the OmniAuth level, not HTTP level
- Test user creation, login, logout, and error flows
- Include id_token in mock for logout testing
- Use helpers to reduce test duplication
- Always reset OmniAuth config after tests

### Key Testing Components Needed:
```ruby
# 1. Enable test mode
OmniAuth.config.test_mode = true

# 2. Mock successful auth
OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[:oidc] = OmniAuth::AuthHash.new({
  provider: 'oidc',
  uid: 'okta-123',
  info: { email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test User' },
  credentials: { id_token: 'fake-id-token' }
})

# 3. Test the callback
post '/users/auth/oidc/callback'

# 4. Reset after tests
OmniAuth.config.mock_auth[:oidc] = nil
```

### CI/CD Considerations:
- No need for real OKTA instance in CI
- All auth testing done via mocks
- Environment variables can be dummy values in test
- Focus on testing the integration points, not OKTA itself

### Additional Research Resources:
- **OmniAuth Wiki**: https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Integration-Testing
- **Rails Testing Guide**: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#testing-your-mailers
- **Devise Wiki on Testing**: https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Test-with-Capybara

## Summary for PR:
The OKTA authentication fixes are complete and tested:
- Existing users can now log in with OKTA (provider/uid update)
- ID token stored for proper OKTA logout  
- Logout redirects to OKTA and clears both sessions
- All flows tested manually and with unit tests
- Environment configuration improved with dotenv-rails
- Comprehensive test infrastructure created based on best practices from major open-source projects

## Session Progress (June 8, 2025 - Morning):
1. ✅ Created PR #666: https://github.com/mitre/vulcan/pull/666
2. ✅ Fixed SonarCloud code duplication issue in sessions_controller_spec.rb
   - Extracted helper methods mock_oidc_settings and mock_http_response
   - Reduced duplication from 26.8% to acceptable levels
3. ✅ Fixed all Rubocop offenses in CI/CD:
   - Removed trailing whitespace
   - Fixed line length issues
   - Used safe navigation operator (&.)
   - Fixed Rails logger to use block syntax
   - Removed unused variables
   - Three commits total: baf19b8, 9709c69, 6009cb4

## Current Status:
- Branch: fix/okta-authentication-issues
- PR #666 created and awaiting CI/CD completion
- All tests passing locally (107 examples, 0 failures)
- Rubocop and SonarCloud issues resolved
- Ready for review once CI/CD passes

## Key Discoveries:
- Okta authentication behavior change was due to "Any two factors" policy in Okta dashboard
- Not a code issue - our implementation is correct
- Multiple .env files were loading with different configurations
- The /oauth2/default vs base URL difference affects authentication policies

## Next Steps:
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline results
- Address any remaining CI/CD issues if they arise
- Once merged, work on full OIDC auto-discovery enhancement as separate PR

## CI/CD Test Failures (As of June 8, 2025):
1. **LDAP Login Test** - Pre-existing failure since June 1st
   - Missing `VULCAN_LDAP_HOST` environment variable in CI workflow
   - Test expects `ldap` service but host not configured
   - Not related to our OKTA changes
   
2. **Rule Duplication Test** - Appears to be timing/data related
   - Passes locally but fails in CI
   - Test creates test data with "this is a test" but expects original SRG data
   - May be due to SRG rules having pre-existing disa_rule_descriptions from XML
   - Intermittent failure suggests test ordering or data dependency issue

## Commits in PR #666:
- e08dbb0: Initial OKTA fixes implementation
- baf19b8: Fix SonarCloud code duplication (extracted test helpers)
- 9709c69: Fix Rubocop offenses (automated fixes)
- 6009cb4: Fix remaining Rubocop issues (manual fixes)
- 13b2253: Fix CI/CD test failures and improve development setup
- 0433f11: Fix LDAP port configuration in CI workflow (first attempt)
- afea92f: Fix LDAP host configuration and SonarCloud code quality issues
- c772c1c: Fix LDAP container port mapping (10389:10389)

## Key Testing Notes:
- Added 7 new OKTA unit tests (all passing)
- Total test count increased from 100 to 107
- OKTA authentication working end-to-end
- CI/CD has 2 failures but neither directly related to OKTA changes

## Final CI/CD Status (June 8, 2025):
- ✅ All OKTA tests pass
- ✅ Rule duplication test fixed
- ✅ SonarCloud code quality - all issues resolved
- ✅ CodeQL security analysis passes
- ✅ All static analysis passes
- ⚠️  1 LDAP test still failing (pre-existing issue since June 1st in master)
  - We improved it from connection failure to user creation issue
  - The LDAP connection now works correctly
  - The remaining issue is that LDAP auth doesn't populate email field correctly
  - This has been failing in master branch since June 1st (last success May 15th)

## CI/CD Fixes Applied (June 8, 2025):
1. **LDAP Test Fix**:
   - Added missing `VULCAN_LDAP_HOST` environment variable
   - Changed host from 'ldap' to 'localhost' (services accessed via localhost in non-container jobs)
   - Fixed port mapping to 10389:10389 (rroemhild/test-openldap exposes LDAP on port 10389, not 389)
   
2. **Rule Duplication Test Fix**:
   - Added code to clear pre-existing SRG data before test
   - Prevents conflict between XML-loaded descriptions and test data
   
3. **SonarCloud Code Quality Fixes**:
   - Added constants to replace duplicated string literals:
     - `BASE_URL` in sessions_controller_spec.rb
     - `OKTA_UID` in user_okta_spec.rb  
     - `LOCAL_LOGIN_TAB` in local_login_spec.rb
   
4. **Development Setup Improvements**:
   - Added .nvmrc file for Node.js version consistency
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude development files and logs
   - Removed temporary test files from tmp/ directory

## Session Progress (June 8, 2025 - Afternoon):
1. ✅ Discovered LDAP authentication was failing due to incorrect port mapping
2. ✅ Root cause: `rroemhild/test-openldap` container exposes port 10389, not 389
3. ✅ Fixed port mapping: `389:10389` (host:container) with `VULCAN_LDAP_PORT: 389`
4. ✅ Added LDAP email extraction fallbacks in User.from_omniauth:
   - Check auth.info.email
   - Fallback to raw_info.mail or raw_info['mail']
   - Handle arrays (take first element)
   - Raise error if no email found
5. ✅ Created comprehensive LDAP unit tests (6 tests, all passing)
6. ✅ Tested email extraction in Rails console - all scenarios work
7. ✅ Fixed Rubocop offenses from new code
8. ✅ Updated PR #666 description with LDAP findings
9. ✅ Pushed all fixes - CI/CD running

## LDAP Configuration Summary:
```yaml
# Correct configuration (now in PR):
ports:
  - 389:10389  # host:container
VULCAN_LDAP_ATTRIBUTE: mail  # Use email as username
VULCAN_LDAP_PORT: 389        # App connects to host port
```

## Final Commits Today:
- 7186e73: Fix LDAP authentication email attribute mapping
- 3be8aad: Refactor LDAP test to reduce code duplication
- 38a68ff: Fix LDAP authentication email extraction and test isolation
- 69df028: Fix LDAP port mapping configuration
- e7ae3e9: Fix Rubocop offenses

## Next Steps:
- Monitor CI/CD results for PR #666
- LDAP authentication test failure is specific to CI environment
- LDAP authentication works correctly when tested locally with the same configuration
- The issue has been failing in master since June 1st (unrelated to our OKTA changes)

## LDAP Testing Results (June 8, 2025):
- Configured local Vulcan to use test LDAP container
- Successfully authenticated with zoidberg@planetexpress.com
- Confirms our email extraction fix and port configuration are correct
- The CI failure is environment-specific, not a code issue
- Fixed CI configuration: Changed ports from 389:10389 to 10389:10389
- Commit 218d894: Fixed LDAP port configuration to match local testing
