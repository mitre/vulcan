# Vulcan Installation

Vulcan can be set up in a few different ways. It can be done by having a vulcan.yml file that has settings for many different configurations. If there is no vulcan.yml file then the configurations will be read in from vulcan.default.yml that has default configuration as well as the ability for the configurations to be set by environment variables.

## Installation

### Dependencies

For Docker:
  * Docker
  * docker-compose

### Run With Docker

Given that Vulcan requires at least a database service, we use Docker Compose.

#### Setup Docker Container (Clean Install)

1. Install Docker
2. Download vulcan by running `git clone https://github.com/mitre/vulcan.git`.
3. Navigate to the base folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located
4. Run the following commands in a terminal window from the vulcan source directory:
   1. `./setup-docker-secrets.sh`
   2. `docker-compose up -d`
   3. `docker-compose run --rm web rake db:create db:schema:load db:migrate`
   4. `docker-compose run --rm web rake db:create_admin`
5. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

#### Managing Docker Container

The following commands are useful for managing the data in your docker container:

- `docker-compose run --rm web rake db:reset` **This destroys and rebuilds the db**
- `docker-compose run --rm web rake db:migrate` **This updates the db**

#### Running Docker Container

Make sure you have run the setup steps at least once before following these steps!

1. Run the following command in a terminal window:
   - `docker-compose up -d`
2. Go to `127.0.0.1:3000` in a web browser

#### Updating Docker Container

A new version of the docker container can be retrieved by running:

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run web rake db:migrate
```

This will fetch the latest version of the container, redeploy if a newer version exists, and then apply any database migrations if applicable. No data should be lost by this operation.

#### Stopping the Container

`docker-compose down` # From the source directory you started from.

### Tasks

Refer to the [main page](https://vulcan.mitre.org/#tasks) to see the available rake tasks that can be scheduled in production.
