# Vulcan Deep Dive Findings
## Date: January 9, 2025
## Purpose: Comprehensive understanding for modernization planning

## Executive Summary
Vulcan is a **mission-critical STIG authoring platform** used for creating security compliance documentation for DISA. It's a complex Rails application with 5+ years of domain-specific business logic that cannot be easily replaced.

## What Vulcan Actually Does (The Domain)

### Core Purpose
Vulcan enables security teams to:
1. **Transform SRGs ‚Üí STIGs**: Convert generic Security Requirements Guides into system-specific Security Technical Implementation Guides
2. **Collaborative Authoring**: Multiple authors/reviewers work on security rules
3. **Generate Compliance Artifacts**: Produce XCCDF files for DISA submission
4. **Create InSpec Code**: Auto-generate security validation scripts

### Key User Workflows
1. Import SRG from DISA ‚Üí Create Component ‚Üí Author Rules ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Export XCCDF
2. Multiple components can satisfy the same SRG requirements
3. Version control and release management for compliance documentation

## Architecture Insights

### The Good (Preserve These)
‚úÖ **XCCDF Processing Library** (37 classes in app/lib/xccdf/)
- This is the crown jewel - unique IP for DISA compliance
- Uses HappyMapper for XML processing
- Cannot be replaced - must be preserved/migrated carefully

‚úÖ **Domain Model is Well-Designed**
- Clean STI hierarchy: BaseRule ‚Üí Rule/SrgRule/StigRule
- Smart polymorphic associations for flexible permissions
- Audit trail on everything (compliance requirement)

‚úÖ **Multi-Provider Auth Works**
- LDAP, GitHub, OIDC with auto-discovery
- Already modernized in recent work
- Race condition handling implemented

### The Bad (Technical Debt)

#### Missing Pieces
‚ùå **No Service Objects** - Business logic scattered in models/controllers
‚ùå **No Background Jobs** - Everything runs synchronously (XCCDF processing could be slow)
‚ùå **No State Management** - 72 Vue components manage their own state
‚ùå **No API Layer** - Controllers serve both HTML and JSON (mixed concerns)

#### Outdated Stack
- Ruby 2.7 (EOL March 2023)
- Rails 6.1 (3+ major versions behind)
- Vue 2 (EOL December 2023)
- Webpacker 5 (deprecated)
- Bootstrap 4 (one major version behind)

#### Code Smells
- **Fat Models**: Rule model is 365 lines
- **Mixed Frontend**: Vue components embedded in Rails views
- **Tight Coupling**: Vue components can't work standalone
- **Synchronous Processing**: No job queue for heavy operations

## Database & Performance

### Schema Complexity
- 19 tables with complex relationships
- STI on base_rules table
- Polymorphic memberships
- JSON columns for flexible metadata
- Soft deletes (deleted_at timestamps)

### Performance Concerns
- Full XCCDF documents stored in database (could be large)
- Potential N+1 queries in rule associations
- No caching strategy beyond basic Rails cache
- All processing is synchronous

## Frontend Analysis

### Current State
- **72 Vue 2 Components** (!!)
- **11 Webpacker entry points**
- **12 Vue mixins** for shared functionality
- **No Vuex** - components handle their own state
- **Tightly coupled** to Rails views

### Critical Components
1. `RuleEditor.vue` - Core editing interface
2. `InspecControlEditor.vue` - Code generation
3. `Rules.vue` - Main management interface
4. `ProjectShow.vue` - Project dashboard

These would need careful migration to Vue 3 or replacement with Hotwire/Inertia.

## Gem Dependencies Analysis

### Blocking Ruby 3 Upgrade
1. **settingslogic** - Already identified, easy fix
2. Need to check: **nokogiri-happymapper** (critical for XCCDF)

### Security & Compliance Gems (Must Keep)
- `audited` - Audit trail (compliance requirement)
- `devise` + `omniauth-*` - Multi-provider auth
- `slack-ruby-client` - Notifications

### Can Be Replaced/Updated
- `amoeba` ‚Üí Native Rails patterns
- `roo` ‚Üí Modern Excel processing
- `fast_excel` ‚Üí Keep (it's good)

## Modernization Strategy Recommendations

### Priority 1: Unblock Upgrades (Week 1)
1. Fix settingslogic (10 minutes)
2. Test nokogiri-happymapper with Ruby 3
3. Update other blocking gems

### Priority 2: Core Infrastructure (Month 1)
1. Ruby 2.7 ‚Üí 3.2
2. Rails 6.1 ‚Üí 7.0
3. PostgreSQL 12 ‚Üí 15

### Priority 3: Frontend Decision (Month 2-3)
Three viable paths:

**Option A: Incremental Vue 3**
- Use Vue 3 migration build
- Component-by-component migration
- Keep existing structure

**Option B: Inertia.js + Vue 3**
- Keep Vue for complex components
- Simplify Rails/Vue integration
- Could use NuxtUI

**Option C: Hotwire + Minimal Vue**
- Replace simple components with Hotwire
- Keep Vue only for RuleEditor, InspecEditor
- Drastically reduce JS complexity

### Priority 4: Add Missing Architecture (Month 4+)
1. Add service objects for business logic
2. Implement background jobs (GoodJob or SolidQueue)
3. Create proper API namespace if needed
4. Add caching layer for XCCDF processing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
üî¥ **XCCDF Library** - Any bugs here affect DISA compliance
üî¥ **Rule Satisfactions** - Complex business logic, easy to break
üî¥ **Authentication** - Security critical

### Medium Risk
üü° Vue component migration (72 components!)
üü° Database migrations (complex relationships)
üü° Test suite updates

### Low Risk
üü¢ Gem updates (mostly straightforward)
üü¢ Bootstrap 4 ‚Üí 5 (mostly CSS)
üü¢ Development tooling updates

## The Bottom Line

**Vulcan is more complex than initially apparent.** It's not just a CRUD app - it's a domain-specific compliance platform with unique business logic that took years to develop.

**Recommendation**:
1. **Don't do a full greenfield rewrite** - Too much domain logic to recreate
2. **Do incremental modernization** - Ruby/Rails first, then frontend
3. **Consider Inertia.js** - Best middle ground for Vue components
4. **Add service layer** - Extract business logic before major changes
5. **Preserve XCCDF library** - This is irreplaceable domain IP

**Timeline**: 4-6 months for full modernization, but can deploy improvements incrementally.
