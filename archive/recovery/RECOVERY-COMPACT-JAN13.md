# RECOVERY PROMPT - Vulcan Rails 7 Upgrade
## Context at Compact: 1% - January 13, 2025
## Status: Rails 7 UPGRADE COMPLETE - Minor UI polish remaining

### üö® CRITICAL FIRST STEPS AFTER COMPACT
1. **MUST READ**: `/Users/alippold/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - User's STRICT preferences and rules
2. **MUST READ**: `/Users/alippold/github/mitre/vulcan/CLAUDE.md` - Project context
3. **CHECK MCP**: Run `mcp__server-memory__open_nodes` with name "Vulcan Rails 7 Upgrade"
4. **CHECK BRANCH**: Currently on `upgrade-settingslogic-ruby31`
5. **SERVER STATUS**: Check if `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` is running

### üìç CURRENT STATE
```bash
pwd: /Users/alippold/github/mitre/vulcan
branch: upgrade-settingslogic-ruby31
server: http://localhost:3000 (foreman start -f Procfile.dev)
login: admin@example.com / 1234567ab!
```

### ‚úÖ WHAT'S COMPLETE (DO NOT REDO)
1. **Rails 7.0.8.7** - Fully upgraded from 6.1.4
2. **Ruby 3.1.6** - Upgraded from 2.7.5
3. **jsbundling-rails** - Migrated from Webpacker with esbuild
4. **Bootstrap Icons** - All 84 MDI icons replaced
5. **Vue 2 IIFE** - Fixed component mounting with IIFE format
6. **Database** - Seeded with test data
7. **Git Commit** - 94 files committed with proper attribution

### üîß RECENT FIXES (Just Before Compact)
1. **ComponentCard.vue** - Fixed icon alignment to display inline
2. **components/show.html.haml** - Fixed v-bind:queried-rule error with `(@rule_json || {}.to_json)`
3. **UI Improvements** - Simplified component card actions with cleaner buttons

### ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES TO ADDRESS
1. **Control Count Bug** - New components show "0 Controls" but should inherit from SRG
   - Components are created from SRGs which have base controls
   - Likely a data loading or association issue
   - Check `component.rules_count` vs actual rules association

2. **Component Card UX** - Could be cleaner, current state:
   - Primary "Open Component" button
   - Export links (CSV, InSpec, XCCDF) as text links
   - Admin actions (Remove, Release) as buttons
   - Icons for Lock and Duplicate

### üìù USER PREFERENCES (MEMORIZE)
- **NO CLAUDE SIGNATURES** in commits
- **ALWAYS USE**: `Authored by: Aaron Lippold<lippold@gmail.com>`
- **NO HACKS** - Fix root causes properly
- Prefers Python/Ruby over sed for text processing
- Gets frustrated with incomplete solutions
- Wants clear communication about what's being done

### üéØ NEXT STEPS
1. **Investigate Control Count** - Why are new components showing 0 controls?
   ```ruby
   # Check in rails console:
   Component.find(ID).rules.count
   Component.find(ID).rules_count
   Component.find(ID).security_requirements_guide.rules.count
   ```

2. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin upgrade-settingslogic-ruby31
   gh pr create --title "feat: Upgrade to Rails 7.0 + Ruby 3.1 + jsbundling"
   ```

3. **Optional UI Polish**
   - Consider badge styles for control count
   - Improve spacing/alignment
   - Add hover states for better feedback

### üîë KEY FILES MODIFIED
- `/app/javascript/components/components/ComponentCard.vue` - UI improvements
- `/app/views/components/show.html.haml` - Fixed v-bind error
- `/esbuild.config.js` - Build configuration
- `/.rubocop.yml` - Fixed duplicate configuration
- `/Gemfile` - Rails 7 + mitre-settingslogic

### üí° TECHNICAL CONTEXT
- **esbuild** uses IIFE format for Vue 2 compatibility
- **Propshaft** replaced Sprockets for asset pipeline
- **Bootstrap Icons** via IconsPlugin, not font files
- **concurrent-ruby** pinned to 1.3.4 (Rails 7.0 Logger bug)
- **REXML** added as explicit dependency for Ruby 3.1

### üêõ DEBUGGING TIPS
If issues arise:
1. Check browser console for Vue warnings
2. Run `yarn build` to rebuild assets
3. Check `rails console` for data associations
4. Use Puppeteer to visually verify UI changes

### üìä DATABASE STATE
- 4 projects (Photon 3, Photon 4, vSphere 7.0, Nothing to See Here)
- 27 components across projects
- 2781 rules in database
- 12 users seeded

### üöÄ RECOVERY COMMAND SEQUENCE
```bash
# After compact, run these to verify state:
cd /Users/alippold/github/mitre/vulcan
git status
git log --oneline -5
ps aux | grep puma | head -1
curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -q "Vulcan" && echo "Server running"
```

### ‚ö° CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. The Rails 7 upgrade is COMPLETE and WORKING
2. Only minor issues remain (control count, UI polish)
3. DO NOT restart the upgrade process
4. The server should already be running
5. All major technical challenges are SOLVED
