# Vulcan

## Description

Vulcan is a tool to help streamline the process of creating STIG-ready securiy guidance documentation and InSpec automated validation profiles.

Vulcan models the STIG intent form and the process of aligning security controls from high-level DISA Security Requirements Guides (SRGs) into [Security Technical Implementation Guides](public.cyber.mil/stigs) (STIGs) tailored to a particular system component. STIG-ready content developed with Vulcan can be provided to DISA for peer review and formal publishing as a STIG.  Vulcan allows the guidance author to develop both human-readable instructions and machine-readable automated validation code at the same time.

## Features

* Model the STIG creation process between the creator (vendor) and the approver (sponsor)
* Write and test InSpec code on a local system, or across SSH, AWS, and Docker targets
* Easily view control status and revision history
* Enable distributed authorship with multiple authors working on sets of controls and reviewing each others' work
* Confidential data in the database is encrypted using symmetric encryption
* Authenticate via the local server, through GitHub, and through configuring an LDAP server.
