# Vulcan

## Description

Vulcan is a tool to help streamline the process of creating STIGs and InSpec security compliance profiles. It models the STIG intent form and
the process of aligning security controls from SRG items into actual STIG security controls.  Vulcan also gives the option while aligning the security controls to
insert inspec code and test across any type of system supported by InSpec.  

## Features

* Model the STIG creation process between the creator(vendor) and the approver(sponsor)
* Write and test InSpec code on a local system, or across SSH, AWS, and Docker
* Easily view the progress on what the status is of each control
* Communicate through the application to make the best decisions on controls
* Confidential data in the database is encrypted using symmetric encryption
* Authenticate via the local server, through github, and through configuring an LDAP server.

## Installation

### Dependencies

For Docker:
  * Docker
  * docker-compose

For Ruby (on Ubuntu):
  * Ruby 2.4.4
  * `build-essentials`
  * Bundler
  * `libq-dev`
  * nodejs

## Run with Ruby

  1. Install dependencies
  2. `bundle install`
  3. `bundle exec rake db:create`
  4. `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
  5. `bundle exec rails server`
  6. Navigate to `localhost:3030`

## Run with Docker

### Building Docker Containers

_These steps need to be performed the first time you build the docker containers,
and whenever you edit the code base._

  1. Install dependencies
  2. `docker-compose build`
  3. `docker-compose run web rake db:migrate`
  4. Generate keys

### Running Docker Containers

  1. `docker-compose up`
  2. Navigate to `localhost:3030`

### Container Troubleshooting

If migrating the db doesn't work (#2 in _Building Docker Containers_), then run:
  * `docker run -itv vulcan_sqlite-data:/srv/dat busybox /bin/sh`
  * `docker container ls -a    # Note the most recent container ID`
  * `docker cp db/* container_id:/var/www/vulcan/db/`

### Stopping the Containers

`docker-compose down`

## Usage

A demo instance can be accessed at inspec-dev.mitre.org

## Configuration

See `docker-compose.yml` for all container configuration options.

##### Host Container on Relative URL

Edit RAILS\_RELATIVE\_URL\_ROOT in `docker-compose.yml`

##### Host Container in Development/Production Mode

Edit RAILS\_ENV in `docker-compose.yml`
