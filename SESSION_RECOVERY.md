3. ✅ Set up esbuild as the JavaScript bundler
4. ✅ Created a basic working build setup with simplified components
5. ✅ Modified the application layout to use the new asset helpers
6. ✅ Set up build scripts and watch mode for development
7. ✅ Successfully built all JavaScript and CSS assets
8. ✅ Migrated all JavaScript entry points (14/14)
9. ✅ Updated all templates to use javascript_include_tag
10. ✅ Fixed import paths in Vue components
11. ✅ Removed all commented out stylesheet_pack_tag references
12. ✅ Added debugging tools to trace Vue initialization issues
13. ✅ Fixed New Project component to properly mount with Vue
14. ✅ Fixed Material Design Icons by properly configuring font loading
15. ✅ Removed problematic bootstrap-vue-shim.js in favor of the official BootstrapVue library
16. ✅ Removed temporary diagnostic components that were causing errors

## Recent Fixes

### Material Design Icons Font Path Resolution ✅

We successfully resolved the MDI icon path issues following these steps:

1. **Root Cause:** 
   - The MDI CSS was looking for fonts at `/assets/materialdesignicons-webfont.*` 
   - Our esbuild configuration was putting them in different locations with hash suffixes

2. **Solution:**
   - Added the proper `stylesheet_link_tag` in application.html.haml:
     ```ruby
     = stylesheet_link_tag 'mdi/materialdesignicons.min', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload'
     ```
   - Configured esbuild to generate non-hashed font files in the correct location
   - Explicitly copied font files to app/assets/builds/
   - Made sure the assetNames configuration in esbuild.config.js was set properly

3. **Best Practice Followed:**
   - Used the asset pipeline as intended rather than manually fixing paths
   - Let Propshaft handle the asset serving
   - Kept original CSS files intact

### Bootstrap Vue Integration Improvements ✅

We made significant improvements to the Bootstrap Vue integration:

1. **Root Cause:**
   - Custom bootstrap-vue-shim.js file was causing conflicts with component registration
   - Diagnostic components were no longer needed but still causing errors

2. **Solution:**
   - Removed bootstrap-vue-shim.js completely
   - Confirmed all files are correctly importing the official BootstrapVue library
   - Verified proper Vue.use(BootstrapVue) usage in all entry points
   - Removed the diagnostic components that were causing errors

3. **Best Practice Followed:**
   - Used the official BootstrapVue library instead of custom shims
   - Maintained consistent imports across all JavaScript entry points
   - Properly registered components using Vue.component

## Current Issues

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Vue Devtools Conflict:**
   - "Another version of Vue Devtools seems to be installed" error
   - This likely comes from the browser extension conflicting with built-in Vue Devtools

2. **Commit Co-authorship Requirements:**
   - Need to update commits to include proper co-authorship attribution
   - All commits must include "Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>"

## Styling and CSS

Our approach is now working correctly:

1. **Bootstrap**: Imported directly in application.scss
2. **Bootstrap Vue**: Included via the asset pipeline
3. **MDI**: Properly loaded via stylesheet_link_tag with fonts in the correct location

## JavaScript Integration

- Vue and Bootstrap Vue are properly initialized with the official library
- All JavaScript packs converted to ES modules and loading properly
- Icons are displaying correctly
- Component registration is working with the official BootstrapVue library

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Commit Co-authorship:**
   - Update recent commits to include proper co-authorship attribution
   - All commits must include "Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>"
   - This must be addressed before merging or continuing with other fixes

2. **Final Testing:**
   - Test each page thoroughly to ensure all components render correctly
   - Focus on previously problematic components

3. **Address Vue Devtools Conflicts:**
   - Consider configuring Vue to handle multiple devtools instances
   - Test in browsers with extensions disabled

## Resources and Configuration

- Docker PostgreSQL is running for development
- Login credentials: admin@example.com / 1234567ab!
- Dev server command: `yarn dev`
- Build command: `yarn build && yarn build:css`

## Helper Tools

We've created several tools to assist with the migration process:

1. **Migration Inventory Generator** - Scans templates for asset pack tags
   - Run: `bundle exec rails migration:find_pack_tags`
   - Output: `MIGRATION_INVENTORY.md`
   - Use this to identify which templates and entry points need migration

2. **Error Log Extractor** - Captures errors from Rails logs
   - Run: `bundle exec rails migration:log_errors`
   - Output: `ERROR_LOG.md`
   - Use this when errors occur to understand what needs fixing

3. **JavaScript Error Logging** - Custom logger for JavaScript errors
   - Configured in `config/environments/development.rb`
   - Output: `log/javascript_errors.log`

4. **Browser Console Debugger** - Captures JavaScript console output
   - Press Shift+Ctrl+L to view logs in browser
   - Stores errors, warnings, and logs for inspection
