# Session Recovery - Sun Mar 16 20:45:03 EDT 2025

## Current Status

We've been working on improving the testing infrastructure for Vulcan, focusing on:
1. Streamlining Docker-based PostgreSQL for testing
2. Creating a database service interface for consistent usage
3. Implementing seeding with different data levels (minimal, standard, demo)

## Completed Tasks
- Created DatabaseService singleton class in spec/support/database_service.rb
- Implemented database CLI interface in bin/db-service
- Updated bin/test-env to use the database service
- Added support for test data seeding with multiple levels
- Created comprehensive testing documentation

## Pending Tasks
1. Ensure LDAP service configuration works properly with Docker
2. Ensure OIDC mock server configuration is correct
3. Test bringing up a full environment
4. Verify database connection and seeding
5. Test server startup and all authentication methods (DB, LDAP, OIDC)

## Next Steps
1. Test the database service to ensure it properly starts/stops PostgreSQL
2. Update OIDC and LDAP setup to use Docker consistently
3. Test the full environment with all authentication methods
4. Document the final testing approach

## Reference Commands
- Start test environment: `bin/test-env --up`
- Check service status: `bin/test-env --status`
- Seed test data: `bin/seed-test-env --demo`
- Stop services: `bin/test-env --down`
