## Recent Fixes

### Asset Pipeline Standardization: Icons and Fonts ✅

We resolved the icon and font display issues by standardizing our approach:

1. **Root Cause:** 
   - Material Design Icons required complex font path configuration
   - Multiple font copies in different directories caused conflicts
   - Custom font loading approaches were brittle and inconsistent

2. **Icon System Solution:**
   - Switched to Bootstrap Icons via the BootstrapVue IconsPlugin:
     ```javascript
     import { BootstrapVue, IconsPlugin } from 'bootstrap-vue'
     Vue.use(BootstrapVue)
     Vue.use(IconsPlugin)
     ```
   - Removed MDI stylesheet_link_tag from application.html.haml
   - Updated all 32 Vue components to use `<b-icon>` components instead of MDI classes:
     ```html
     <!-- Old MDI approach -->
     <i class="mdi mdi-home"></i>
     
     <!-- New Bootstrap Icons approach -->
     <b-icon icon="house"></b-icon>
     ```
   - Created automated migration script to convert all components
   - Simplified esbuild configuration with standard asset naming:
     ```javascript
     assetNames: '[name]-[hash].[ext]'
     ```

3. **Font System Solution:**
   - Standardized on Bootstrap's native font stack
   - Removed all custom web font files and imports
   - Updated application.scss to properly leverage Bootstrap font variables:
     ```scss
     // Use Bootstrap's native font stack
     body {
       font-family: var(--font-family-sans-serif);
     }
     ```
   - No additional web fonts are loaded - leveraging system fonts for best performance

4. **Advantages of Our Approach:**
   - Native integration with Bootstrap Vue ecosystem
   - No font path configuration issues
   - Cleaner component-based syntax for icons
   - Consistent design language across the app
   - Simpler asset pipeline configuration
   - Better performance by using system fonts
   - Reduced bundle size by eliminating custom font files

5. **Best Practice Followed:**
   - Used the most integrated solutions for our tech stack
   - Eliminated redundant configuration
   - Documented both approaches in CLAUDE.md
   - Removed all unused font files
   - Created reusable migration tools

### Bootstrap Vue Integration Improvements ✅

We made significant improvements to the Bootstrap Vue integration:

1. **Root Cause:**
   - Custom bootstrap-vue-shim.js file was causing conflicts with component registration
   - Diagnostic components were no longer needed but still causing errors

2. **Solution:**
   - Removed bootstrap-vue-shim.js completely
   - Confirmed all files are correctly importing the official BootstrapVue library
   - Verified proper Vue.use(BootstrapVue) usage in all entry points
   - Removed the diagnostic components that were causing errors

3. **Best Practice Followed:**
   - Used the official BootstrapVue library instead of custom shims
   - Maintained consistent imports across all JavaScript entry points
   - Properly registered components using Vue.component

### PR Preparation and Testing Planning ✅

We've prepared the necessary documentation for the final stage:

1. **Testing Plan:**
   - Created TESTING_PLAN.md with comprehensive approach for verification
   - Added detailed component testing matrix with specific testing steps
   - Included browser compatibility testing requirements
   - Added visual rendering test specifications and console error monitoring procedures
   - Created a framework for evaluating Vue Devtools conflicts

2. **PR Template:**
   - Developed PR_TEMPLATE.md with clear summary of migration changes
   - Added explicit co-authorship statement acknowledging all contributors
   - Included references to all documentation resources
   - Linked to testing plan for verification purposes

## Current Issues

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Vue Devtools Conflict:**
   - "Another version of Vue Devtools seems to be installed" error
   - This likely comes from the browser extension conflicting with built-in Vue Devtools

2. **Commit Co-authorship Requirements:**
   - Need to update commits to include proper co-authorship attribution
   - All commits must include "Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>"
   - Currently investigating best approach for modifying git history

3. **SRG Rule Display Issues:**
   - SRG detail page shows title and date but not rule content
   - Console errors indicating model data structure mismatches
   - Working on adapting STIG Vue components to handle SRG data
   - Need to resolve differences between SRG and STIG models

## Styling and CSS

Our approach is now working correctly:

1. **Bootstrap**: Imported directly in application.scss
2. **Bootstrap Vue**: Included via the asset pipeline
3. **MDI**: Properly loaded via stylesheet_link_tag with fonts in the correct location

## JavaScript Integration

- Vue and Bootstrap Vue are properly initialized with the official library
- All JavaScript packs converted to ES modules and loading properly
- Icons are displaying correctly
- Component registration is working with the official BootstrapVue library

## Next Steps

✅ **Asset Pipeline Standardization - COMPLETED:**
   - ✅ Converted all 32 Vue components from MDI to Bootstrap Icons
   - ✅ Created comprehensive icon mapping between MDI and Bootstrap Icons
   - ✅ Created and used conversion scripts for automation
   - ✅ Removed all MDI dependencies and font files
   - ✅ Standardized font handling to use Bootstrap's native font stack
   - ✅ Updated all documentation to reflect our approach
   - ✅ Successfully rebuilt application with standardized asset pipeline

3. **Complete Final jsbundling-rails Migration Testing:**
   - Test all 14 JavaScript entry points thoroughly
   - Verify asset precompilation in production mode
   - Test with different browsers and environments
   - Ensure all JavaScript dependencies load correctly
   - This is critical to close out the remaining 2% of the migration

4. **Fix SRG Rule Display:**
   - Debug model differences between SRG and STIG
   - Create adapters or normalizers for SRG data structure
   - Ensure SRG data is compatible with existing components
   - Test component display with SRG data

5. **Fix Commit Co-authorship:**
   - Find a working approach to modify git history without merge conflicts
   - All commits must include "Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>"
   - Alternative: Consider using PR-level acknowledgment if git history modification proves too complex

6. **Execute Testing Plan:**
   - Follow the detailed TESTING_PLAN.md for verification
   - Test each component marked with ⚠️ in our tracking table
   - Focus particularly on complex Vue components and form submissions
   - Document any issues found during testing

7. **Address Vue Devtools Conflicts:**
   - Configure Vue.config to handle multiple devtools instances
   - Test in browsers with extensions disabled
   - Document a recommended approach for developers

## Resources and Configuration

- Docker PostgreSQL is running for development
- Login credentials: admin@example.com / 1234567ab!
- Dev server command: `yarn dev`
- Build command: `yarn build && yarn build:css`

## Helper Tools

We've created several tools to assist with the migration process:

1. **Migration Inventory Generator** - Scans templates for asset pack tags
   - Run: `bundle exec rails migration:find_pack_tags`
   - Output: `MIGRATION_INVENTORY.md`
   - Use this to identify which templates and entry points need migration

2. **Error Log Extractor** - Captures errors from Rails logs
   - Run: `bundle exec rails migration:log_errors`
   - Output: `ERROR_LOG.md`
   - Use this when errors occur to understand what needs fixing

3. **JavaScript Error Logging** - Custom logger for JavaScript errors
   - Configured in `config/environments/development.rb`
   - Output: `log/javascript_errors.log`

4. **Browser Console Debugger** - Captures JavaScript console output
   - Press Shift+Ctrl+L to view logs in browser
   - Stores errors, warnings, and logs for inspection
