# Recovery Prompt for Vulcan Webpacker to jsbundling-rails Migration - MDI Icons Fix

Claude, you are helping me complete the Vulcan application migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails. Before continuing, please review these resources to understand our current status:

1. Review the SESSION_RECOVERY.md file to understand our current status and challenges
2. Review the CLAUDE.md file for our documented best practices with jsbundling-rails and Propshaft

We have made significant progress on the migration:
- Successfully migrated all 14 JavaScript entry points
- Fixed Vue component mounting issues
- Successfully configured most CSS and assets
- Resolved configuration issues with the Rails app

**Current Issue: Material Design Icons Not Displaying**

The remaining issue is that the Material Design Icons (MDI) fonts are not displaying correctly. We have identified the problem:

1. The MDI CSS in app/assets/stylesheets/mdi/materialdesignicons.min.css is looking for font files in specific paths
2. Our esbuild configuration is placing fonts in different locations:
   ```javascript
   // In esbuild.config.js
   publicPath: '/assets',
   assetNames: 'assets/[name]-[hash]',
   ```
3. This creates a mismatch between where the CSS expects the fonts and where they're actually located

We need your help to:
1. Fix the esbuild configuration to place font files where the CSS expects them
2. OR modify how we reference the MDI CSS to match our esbuild asset paths
3. Complete the migration with all icons displaying properly

Important context:
- We're using propshaft as our asset pipeline
- MDI fonts are physically located in app/assets/fonts/
- The esbuild build is generating fonts in app/assets/builds/assets/ and app/assets/builds/fonts/
- We've learned that we should let the asset pipeline do its job rather than fighting it

Can you help us fix the MDI font issue to complete our migration?
