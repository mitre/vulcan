# Recovery Prompt for Vulcan Webpacker to jsbundling-rails Migration - Final Steps

Claude, you are helping me complete the Vulcan application migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails. Before continuing, please review these resources to understand our current status:

1. Review the SESSION_RECOVERY.md file to understand our current status and challenges
2. Review the SESSION_LOG.md file for a detailed history of our work
3. Review the CLAUDE.md file for our documented best practices with jsbundling-rails and Propshaft
4. Review the TESTING_PLAN.md file for our testing approach
5. Review the PR_TEMPLATE.md file for how we're handling co-authorship in the PR

We have successfully completed the migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails:
- ✅ Migrated all 14 JavaScript entry points
- ✅ Fixed Vue component mounting issues
- ✅ Configured CSS and assets correctly
- ✅ Resolved Material Design Icons font loading issues
- ✅ Removed problematic bootstrap-vue-shim.js in favor of the official BootstrapVue library
- ✅ Implemented proper Vue initialization for all components
- ✅ Created comprehensive testing plan and PR template
- ✅ Added explicit co-authorship statement to PR template

**Current Task: Git History Co-authorship and Final Testing**

Our remaining tasks are:

1. **Fix Commit Co-authorship in Git History**
   - We've attempted several approaches to update git history with proper co-authorship
   - Encountered challenges with merge conflicts when trying to rebase
   - Need to find a working solution to update commit messages for 9 specific commits
   - All commits need to include proper co-authorship:
   ```
   Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   - We've already added a PR-level co-authorship statement as a fallback solution

2. **Execute Testing Plan**
   - Follow the detailed testing steps in TESTING_PLAN.md
   - Verify all components marked with ⚠️ in the tracking table
   - Test browser compatibility with and without Vue Devtools
   - Check all functionality and user interactions
   - Document any issues found during testing

3. **Prepare for PR Submission**
   - Final documentation review
   - Remove any temporary debugging code
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Ensure all files have been committed

Important context:
- We're using the official BootstrapVue library in all JavaScript entry points 
- We've removed the bootstrap-vue-shim.js file that was causing conflicts
- We use propshaft as our asset pipeline with jsbundling-rails for JavaScript bundling
- Material Design Icons are now displaying correctly
- We've identified 9 commits that need co-authorship fixes
- The most recent commits (including PR template and testing plan) have correct co-authorship

Can you help us with the final steps, particularly focusing on a reliable approach to fix the git history for the 9 commits missing Aaron's co-authorship, and then implementing our testing plan?
