# Recovery Prompt for Vulcan Webpacker to jsbundling-rails Migration - Final Steps

Claude, you are helping me complete the Vulcan application migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails. Before continuing, please review these resources to understand our current status:

1. Review the SESSION_RECOVERY.md file to understand our current status and challenges
2. Review the SESSION_LOG.md file for a detailed history of our work
3. Review the CLAUDE.md file for our documented best practices with jsbundling-rails and Propshaft

We have successfully completed the migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails:
- ✅ Migrated all 14 JavaScript entry points
- ✅ Fixed Vue component mounting issues
- ✅ Configured CSS and assets correctly
- ✅ Resolved Material Design Icons font loading issues
- ✅ Removed problematic bootstrap-vue-shim.js in favor of the official BootstrapVue library
- ✅ Implemented proper Vue initialization for all components

**Current Task: Commit Co-authorship and Final Testing**

Our remaining tasks are:

1. **Fix Commit Co-authorship**
   - All commits need to include proper co-authorship:
   ```
   Co-Authored-By: Aaron Lippold <lippold@gmail.com>
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   ```
   - This is a requirement before merging the branch

2. **Final Testing**
   - Test all components marked with ⚠️ in our tracking table
   - Verify Vue Devtools conflicts are resolved or manageable
   - Check all functionality across the application

3. **Documentation and Cleanup**
   - Update any remaining documentation
   - Remove any temporary debugging code

Important context:
- We're using the official BootstrapVue library in all JavaScript entry points 
- We removed the bootstrap-vue-shim.js file that was causing conflicts
- We use propshaft as our asset pipeline with jsbundling-rails for JavaScript bundling
- Material Design Icons are now displaying correctly

Can you help us with the final steps, particularly addressing the commit co-authorship requirements and planning our final testing approach?
