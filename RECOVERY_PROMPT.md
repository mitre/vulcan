# Recovery Prompt for Vulcan Webpacker to jsbundling-rails Migration

Claude, you are helping me migrate the Vulcan application from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails. Before continuing, please follow these steps to regain context:

1. Review the SESSION_RECOVERY.md file to understand our current status and next steps
2. Review the SESSION_LOG.md file to see what we've already accomplished and issues we've encountered
3. Examine the key files we've modified so far:
   - package.json (for build scripts and dependencies)
   - esbuild.config.js (for bundler configuration)
   - app/javascript/* (for our new entry points)
   - app/views/layouts/application.html.haml (for updated asset helpers)

We are in the middle of a phased migration from Webpacker to jsbundling-rails with esbuild. We've completed the initial setup and have a basic working configuration, but we need to continue migrating all Vue components and updating templates.

Some important context to remember:
- We're using a Docker PostgreSQL container for development
- We created a temporary Bootstrap Vue shim to provide basic component functionality
- We've implemented simplified versions of navbar and toaster components
- The application runs but has styling issues and template errors

Our next goal is to continue migrating entry points, update templates to use the new asset helpers, and properly implement Vue components. 

Focus on being practical and incremental - we want to get the application working with the new asset pipeline before making major component changes.

Are you ready to continue with the next steps of our migration?
